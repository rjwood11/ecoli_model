Harpeth Conservancy's E. coli models are built using weather and river flow data to predict E. coli levels at each of our sampling locations:

## Including Plots



```{r weather data, echo=FALSE}

### Lat Lon for Bounding Box
# Lower Right - 35.781712, -86.307935
# Lower Left - 35.765955, -87.397468
# Top Right - 36.362524, -86.311819
# Top Left - 36.403176, -87.346973






### Set a range
lat <- c(35.78, 36.40)                
lon <- c(-87.36, -86.31)   

### Get a map
map <- get_map(location = c(lon = mean(lon), lat = mean(lat)), zoom = 11,
               maptype = "toner", source = "stamen")

ggmap(map)

### When you draw a figure, you limit lon and lat.      
foo <- ggmap(map)+
       scale_x_continuous(limits = c(35.78, 36.40), expand = c(0, 0)) +
       scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-87.36, -86.31), expand = c(0, 0))

foo



stations<-ncdc_stations(extent = c(35.78, -87.36, 36.40, -86.31))



ncdc(datasetid = 'GHCND', locationid = 'ZIP:37221', datatypeid = 'PRCP', startdate = start.date, enddate = end.date, limit = 5)  


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
