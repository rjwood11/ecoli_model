Harpeth Conservancy's E. coli models are built using weather and river flow data to predict E. coli levels at each of our sampling locations:



```{r packages, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(rnoaa)


```



```{r discharge data}

site_no<-c("03433500","03433500","03433500","03432350","03433500","03434500","03431700",
           "03431700","03431060","03431060","0343233905")

Location<-c("Natchez Trace", "Moran Rd. Bridge", "Hwy 100 Boat Launch", "Lowhead Dam",  "Coley Davis", "Hwy 70",            
            "Richland Creek","Jackson Blvd",   "Whitsett Park", "Mill Creek Greenway", "Lewisburg Pike")

LocLookup <- data.frame(Location, site_no)

pCode <- c("00060", "00065","00010","00400")
start.date <- "2020-06-24"
end.date <- "2022-10-10"

Daily <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = site_no,
                     parameterCd = pCode,
                     startDate = start.date,
                     endDate = end.date)

Daily <- renameNWISColumns(Daily)
names(Daily)



```

## Including Plots



```{r weather data, echo=FALSE}

ncdc(datasetid = 'PRECIP_HLY', locationid = 'ZIP:28801', datatypeid = 'HPCP', startdate = '2013-10-01', enddate = '2013-12-01', limit = 5)  


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
